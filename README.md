### Requirements
1. Microsoft Visual Studio with .NET CORE 5

### How to Run the Project
1. Download the Project 
2. Change the Connection String in appsettings.json. We have included the login module in our project (just a basic module to run the project)
3. In the Visual Community, run the following commands in Nuget Package Manager Console:
    * add-migration createDB
    * update-databse
4. Run the Project through IIS Express.
    
### Points to be noted
The Models folder contains all the classes and the requirements for the attributes in the classes. The controller contains all the routing for the views and Views contain all the cshtml pages.

We have included some dummy records to display in the Get Quote Price and Quote History web pages.
